## Homelessness in San Diego, Factors that Impact Homelessness

This project explores **homelessness trends** in San Diego and across the United States, highlighting key factors such as urbanization, demographics, and geographic variations. The analysis was performed using **R Studio** for data analysis and visualization and **Power BI** for creating dashboards.

## Power BI Dashboard

We used Power BI to analyze and visualize homelessness and related trends across the U.S. and California. The dashboard includes interactive visuals showcasing homelessness by state, age, and race, trends in chronic homelessness, and the impact of drug overdoses. The slicers give detailed filtering by year and demographics to gain deeper insights.

## Key Insights:
- Homelessness Trends: California and New York have the highest homelessness rates.
- Post-2020 increase in homelessness linked to the pandemic
- Chronic Homelessness: PSH beds are increasing, but chronic homelessness remains a challenge.
- Drug Overdose in California: Opioids and synthetic drugs are the leading causes of overdose deaths.
- Demographics: The 	35–44 age group and racial minorities are most affected and Veteran homelessness is steadily declining.

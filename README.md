# Homelessness in San Diego, Factors that Impact Homelessness

This project explores homelessness trends in San Diego and across the U.S., focusing on factors like urbanization and demographics. The analysis was conducted using R Studio and Power BI.

## Key Insights
- **Age Group Analysis:** The 35–44 age group is the most affected, while seniors (65+) are least affected due to social programs.
- **Urban vs. Rural:** Major cities have significantly higher homelessness rates than rural areas.
- **Demographics:** Men, people of color, and veterans face higher risks of homelessness.

## Power BI Dashboard

We used Power BI to analyze and visualize homelessness and related trends across the U.S. and California. The dashboard includes interactive visuals showcasing homelessness by state, age, and race, trends in chronic homelessness, and the impact of drug overdoses. The slicers give detailed filtering by year and demographics to gain deeper insights.

## Key Insights:
- Homelessness Trends: California and New York have the highest homelessness rates.
- Post-2020 increase in homelessness linked to the pandemic
- Chronic Homelessness: PSH beds are increasing, but chronic homelessness remains a challenge.
- Drug Overdose in California: Opioids and synthetic drugs are the leading causes of overdose deaths.
- Demographics: The 	35–44 age group and racial minorities are most affected and Veteran homelessness is steadily declining.
